# Steps
- Open STS 
- File->New->Spring Starter Project
- Enter details (like Group, Artifact, etc) 
- Choose Maven and Java 8
- Dependencies selected
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Web
- H2 Database

# Notes
- There is a  nice capability of Spring. If I add files ending with dot SQL in src/main/resource folder (schema.sql, data.sql), then when Spring starts up it will execute both of those SQL files and generate the database for me.
